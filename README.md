# Image Segmentation with D-Wave Quantum Computer
This repository demonstrates how to perform image segmentation using the D-Wave quantum computer. 
the implementation utilizes a Discrete Quadratic Model (DQM) to segment an image into distinct regions
based on pixel similarity.

# Overview
Image segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision that involves partitioning an image into
multiple segments or regions. This can help in identifying objects, boundaries, and other significant
features within the image. In this implementation, we leverage quantum computing to optimize the segmentation process.

# Key Features
Image Input: Accepts an image file or generates a random image for segmentation.
Quantum Computing: Utilizes D-Wave's hybrid DQM solver for efficient segmentation.
Visualization: Displays the original and segmented images side by side.
Usage
To run the image segmentation demo, execute the following command in your terminal:

bash
Run
Copy code
python image_segmentation.py <image_file>

If no image file is provided, the program will generate a random image based on user-defined dimensions
and the number of segments.

Example Command
bash
Run
Copy code
python image_segmentation.py my_image.jpg

# Code Overview
The code implements the following steps:

Image Loading: Reads an image file or generates a random image.
Weight Function: Defines a function to calculate the weight based on pixel differences.
DQM Construction: Constructs a Discrete Quadratic Model to represent the segmentation problem.
DQM Solver: Uses D-Wave's LeapHybridDQMSampler to solve the segmentation problem.
Output Generation: Saves the segmented image and displays the original alongside the segmented version.

# Key Functions
Weight Function: Computes the difference between pixels to determine their similarity.

segmented image side by side.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of combining classical image processing techniques with quantum computing
to perform image segmentation. By formulating the segmentation task as a Discrete Quadratic Model (DQM), the 
D-Wave quantum solver efficiently finds optimal segmentations that group similar pixels together. This approach
highlights how hybrid quantum-classical algorithms can be applied to complex computer vision tasks. As quantum
technology advances, such methods hold great promise for improving accuracy and speed in image analysis applications
across various domains.
